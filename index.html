                    I am a professional photographer specializing in portrait, wedding, 
                    and product photography. I have always had a passion for art and photography, 
                    and especially for the creativity and self-expression associated with artistic
                    creation and experiences. This passion has deeply shaped my interest in pursuing 
                    photography more professionally and as a future career. Learning about photography
                    has provided me an outlet to learn something new and to constantly engage in a 
                    dialogue with my environment. I graduated in professional photography from
                    Dawson College in Montreal and have two years of professional photography experience.
