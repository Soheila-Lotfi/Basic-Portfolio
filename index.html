                        I am a professional photographer specializing in portrait, wedding, 
                        and product photography. I have always had a passion for art and photography, 
                        and especially for the creativity and self-expression associated with artistic
                        creation and experiences. This passion has deeply shaped my interest in pursuing 
                        photography more professionally and as a future career.

                        Learning about photography
                        has provided me an outlet to learn something new and to constantly engage in a 
                        dialogue with my environment.
                        <br>
                        I graduated in professional photography from
                        Dawson College in Montreal and have two years of professional photography experience.
